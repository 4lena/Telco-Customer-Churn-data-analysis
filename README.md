# Telco Customer Churn Data Analysis

<!-- introduction -->
## About The Project

Doing data analysis on the 'Telco-Customer-Churn' dataset that is aimed at understanding the factors that lead to customer churn in a Telco company. To begin with, I first explored the dataset and gained an understanding of its structure and contents. Next, I checked the validity of the data to ensure that it is clean. This involved handling duplications, incorrect values, and missing values. Then, I performed some data preparation to transform and prepare it for analysis. Finally, I conducted some charts and calculations to identify the factors that contribute to customer churn.
